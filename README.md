## Overview
This is my solution to the [Survey form challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form). 

### The challenge

- This is the 2/5 challenge of the Responsive Web Certification from freecodecamp. Basically consist on create a survey form aplying the knowledge adquired on the course. Then I had some requirements to follow in the development process and I have tested an passed all of it.

## My process

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

This is my second project for this certifaction and I felt comfortable doing it. 
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
I learned more about web design and many topics about forms becauses I had never made one. Then I used git in order to handle the versions of the project.
I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs, I'll work on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills. I'll keep learning git too because it's important and useful tool for co-working.
